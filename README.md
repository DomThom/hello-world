Hi.
I'm really new at this, and just have a little experience with programming.
I learned Pascal. Yeah, that ancient-language. But it's very pleasing when finally you've learn something and can make use of it.
With pascal, I created some apps that make my life at school easier. For example I build application to check if a number is a prime or not, app to list all the factors of the number input-ed, and app to invers 3x3 matrix. I bought an apps called Pascal GUI on my android, and with that, I can make an APK of my app, so I can share it with my friends :)

But, I'm still nothing with C++, javascript, phyton, and I want to learn more. Maybe I can create a cool Android or Mac apps eventually.

Anyway, thanks.

DomThom, Pascal Soldier.
